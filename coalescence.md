### Energy

* *"If you want to find the secrets of the universe, think in terms of energy, [frequency](https://youtu.be/4z4QdiqP-q8) and [vibration."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2JeHlFtMDM&list=PL1EuMLmr80RMtLNxS-RtmQPuWAPccsAvt)* - [Nikola Tesla](https://imgur.com/Qv9p5IF)

* "When a piece of seemingly solid matter like a human hand is placed under a microscope, we can see that it is made up of molecules. As we move closer, we see [atoms,](https://youtu.be/yqLlgIaz1L0) the tiny shadowy balls dancing around their fixed locations. We focus on one of the atoms; its interior is lightly veiled by a cloud of [electrons.](https://youtu.be/OsZHRCuTIS8) We come closer, increasing the magnification. The shell dissolves and we look on the inside to find… ***nothing.*** Somewhere within that emptiness, we know is a nucleus. We scan the space, and there it is, a tiny dot. *At last,* we have discovered something hard and solid, a reference point. *But no!* as we move closer to the nucleus, it too begins to dissolve. ***It too is nothing more than an oscillating field, waves of rhythm.*** Inside the nucleus are other organized fields: protons, neutrons, even smaller “particles.” Each of these, upon our approach, also dissolve into pure rhythm." - [George Leonard, The Silent Pulse](https://embright.org/the-silent-pulse/)

* “Matter is mostly ghostly empty space.” - [Sir Arthur Eddington, physicist](https://imgur.com/hyMq7T4)

* “The nucleus of an atom takes up as much room in the atom as an ant on a football field.” - [Diane Powell, neuroscientist](https://doingfaith.com/always-there-is-life/the-esp-enigma.html)

* "Nothing rests; everything moves; everything vibrates." - [The Kybalion](https://www.sacred-texts.com/eso/kyb/kyb11.htm)

* "Solid matter, in the strict construction of the term, simply does not exist. The Universe is composed of interacting energy fields, some at rest and some in motion. It is, in and of itself, one gigantic [hologram](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/01/170130083231.htm) of unbelievable complexity." - [De-classified CIA document](https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00788R001700210016-5.pdf) 

* "Everything is made of atoms ... Everything that animals do, atoms do. There is nothing that living things do that cannot be understood from the point of view that they are made of atoms acting according to the laws of physics. - [Richard P. Feynman, Nobel Prize-winning theoretical physicist](https://todayinsci.com/F/Feynman_Richard/FeynmanRichard-Atom-Quotations.htm)

* “Atoms consist of particles and these particles are not made of any material stuff. When we observe them, we never see any substance; what we observe are dynamic patterns continually changing into one another - a continuous dance of energy.” - [Fritjof Capra, physicist](https://imgur.com/V5PlM1R)

* "Once you can accept the universe as matter expanding into nothing that is something, wearing stripes with plaid comes easy." - [Albert Einstein](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/16479-once-you-can-accept-the-universe-as-matter-expanding-into) 

* "It´s like a thought wave - invisible state OR quantum wave function spread over space and time. Not a wave of matter, but a wave in what? In a universal ocean - an ocean of pure potentiality - a unified field - superstring field that of which we are all made of." - [John Hagelin, Ph.D.](https://imgur.com/eULXDOI)

* "I realized that I can no longer define the boundaries of my body. I can't define where I begin and where I end, because the atoms and the molecules of my arm blended with the atoms and molecules of the wall. I felt at one with all the energy that was, and it was beautiful there.” - [Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor, neuroscientist ](https://w.wiki/Cwh)

* “She wasn't doing a thing that I could see, except standing there leaning on the balcony railing, holding the universe together.” - [J.D. Salinger](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/244426-she-wasn-t-doing-a-thing-that-i-could-see-except)

### Entanglement

* *"The infinitely far-away is not only near, but it is infinitely near."* - [Edward Conze, Buddhist linguist](https://imgur.com/jlvewBA)

* "There is no empty space. When we go *down - down - down* - there is vibrations - stuff popping - invisible connections - ***entanglement."*** - [Fred Alan Wolf, theoretical physicist](https://imgur.com/r5NuS1w)

* [Quantum entanglement](https://w.wiki/DEw) is a label for when particles cannot be described independently of the state of the others, even when separated by a large distance. The term was coined by Nobel Prize-winning physicist Erwin Schrödinger who stated - *“I would not call it one but rather the characteristic trait of quantum mechanics.”*

* "Entanglement can occur in large systems as well as warm ones—[*including living organisms.*](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/schroedingers-bacterium-could-be-a-quantum-biology-milestone/) We can’t simply write quantum effects off as mere details. The entanglements are primary." - [Vlatko Vedral, Oxford physicist](https://youtu.be/8NrecEP5dtM)

* "According to the [Big Bang Theory](https://i.imgur.com/A2C6Vpc.jpg), all the matter in the universe was originally in contact, concentrated in a *“[very hot dot](https://w.wiki/EvA)”* of matter-energy that exploded resulting in the universe. If the theory is valid, a requirement for [non-local connection](https://w.wiki/FDG) was met early on." - [Larry Dossey, One Mind](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17381613) 

* "A non-local connection links up one location with another without crossing space, without decay, and without delay." - [Nick Herbert, physicist](https://imgur.com/SS6v6i3) 

* "Universal non-locality offers us profound evidence that our Universe is fundamentally interconnected as a unified entity." - [Jude Currivan, cosmologist](https://imgur.com/wG8b0RA)

* “We live in a highly entangled, interconnected universe where a fundamental information field is shared to generate organized matter and eventually self-organizing systems, leading to organisms reflecting back on themselves and asking fundamental questions about existence." - [Nassim Haramein, physicist](https://imgur.com/xAP3VoG)

* "Inseparable quantum interconnectedness of the whole universe is the fundamental reality..." - [David Bohm, theoretical physicist](https://w.wiki/CmH)

* "In principle, any objects that have ever interacted are forever entangled, and therefore what happens to one influences the other. Quantum theory has this connectedness extending over the entire universe." - [Rosenblum/Kuttner, physicists](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/100027)

* "Reality is woven from strange, “holistic” threads that aren’t located precisely in space or time. Tug on a dangling loose end from this fabric of reality, and the whole cloth twitches, instantly, throughout all space and time." - [Dean Radin, Senior Scientist at IONS](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/216543)

* "The entangled objects somehow communicate instantaneously at a distance. Distance has no meaning. Light-years have no meaning. Space has no meaning. In a sense, the entangled objects are not even communicating. They are the same thing. ***All is one."*** - [Roger Ebert](https://w.wiki/DSo)

### Illusory Separation 

* *"Devoid of space / Is the mind of grace."* - [Jack Kerouac](https://imgur.com/PuClHTX)

* “A human being is part of the whole, called by us ‘universe,’ a part limited in time and space. He experiences his thoughts and feelings as something separate from the rest—a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness." - [Albert Einstein](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/369)

* "The hours by the window had filled me with a direct certainty that time, space and causality, that the isolation, separateness and spatio-temporal limitations of the self were merely optical illusions…" - [Arthur Koestler, Sonning Prize Winner](https://imgur.com/GfwLqgz)

* German philosopher [Arthur Schopenhauer](https://w.wiki/DEx) believed that humans risk their lives for another because the rescuer realizes that he or she and the individual in need ***are one.*** He stated - *“[Universal compassion](https://news.uchicago.edu/story/helping-your-fellow-rat-rodents-show-empathy-driven-behavior) is the only guarantee of morality. My own true inner being actually exists in every living creature as truly and immediately as known to my consciousness only in myself. This realization is the ground of compassion upon which all true, that is to say unselfish, virtue rests...”*

* "At the decisive moment, the sense of separation is [*totally overcome.*](https://realitysandwich.com/181095/saving_others/) The prior sense of separateness is simply a function of the way we experience things in space and time. Because we experience ourselves as one with the person in need, when we risk our life to save them, ***we are essentially saving ourselves."*** - [Larry Dossey, One Mind](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17381613)

* "Unselfishness is God." - [Swami Vivekananda](https://w.wiki/CwK)

* “Lovers don’t finally meet somewhere. They’re in each other all along.” - [Mawlana Jalal-al-Din Rumi](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/83514)

* "Dense bodies actually prevent sight; the less material the intervening substance is, the more clearly we see... ***The gods see, each singly and all as one...*** It must, no doubt, seem strange that my feelings be felt by someone else, my goodness another's too, my desire, his desire, ***all our experience shared with each other so that the very universe itself would feel whatever I felt.*** *For all is transparent, nothing dark, nothing resistant; every being is lucid to every other, in breadth and depth;* ***light runs through light. Light everywhere meets with light; since every thing contains all things in itself, and again sees all things in another."*** - [Plotinus, Enneads, 204-270 AD.](https://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/plotenn/index.htm) 

* "The distinction between yourself and others is ***not visible*** to us. Thus, to learn is the same as to teach... *"Love"* implies a unity that is so great that we do not see each other simply as close friends, or brothers and sisters, but, ideally, ***we see one being.*** - [Ra](https://redd.it/6dbh63) / [Carla Rueckert, Law of One](https://www.llresearch.org/home.aspx) 

* note - Humans only see [0.0035%](http://www.madsci.org/posts/archives/2007-08/1188407794.Ph.r.html) of the [electromagnetic spectrum.](https://i.imgur.com/wEV9MoJ.jpg)

* "The inner self is conscious of itself both as an individuality and as an individuality that is a part of all other consciousness. The outer ego is not continuously aware of this fact. If the ego were aware of the ***constant barrage of telepathic communications*** that do impinge upon it, it would have a most difficult time retaining a sense of identity." - [Jane Roberts, The Seth Material](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/324424)

* The word [*telepathy*](https://w.wiki/D8d) is derived from Ancient Greek "[*têle*](https://w.wiki/D8e)" (“at a distance”) and "[*páthos*](https://w.wiki/D8k)" ("I feel, suffer.”) 

* In 2013, Bryan Williams reported a [meta-analysis](https://imgur.com/a/yXVsQlU) based on [59 Ganzfeld telepathy studies.](https://w.wiki/Cwr) The results had a hit rate of ***30-32%.*** It's stated - *"The psi ganzfeld effect has indeed been replicated by ‘a broader range of investigators’ under stringent standards."*

* A recent [study from Princeton](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2922522/) showed that brains can become interconnected, looking at the brain [f-MRI scans](https://imgur.com/a/98Cf44S) of speaker and listener. It's stated - *"We used the speaker's spatio-temporal brain activity to model listeners’ brain activity and found that the speaker's activity is spatially and temporally coupled with the listener's activity."* This has also been shown between [parents and their babies.](https://redd.it/enb4dj)

* "For years parents and therapists have reported to me that their nonverbal autistic children can access their thoughts by an unclear process. The children report they *“see the other’s mind.”* I have tested two of these children with randomized numbers. ***Hayley gave 155 correct out of 162 on random digits and Akhil was 100% accurate."*** - [Diane Powell, neuropsychiatrist](http://www.consciousness.arizona.edu/documents/TSC2017AbstractBook-final-5.10.17-final.pdf)

* In a [study by Dr. Peoc’h](https://www.scientificexploration.org/docs/9/jse_09_2_peoch.pdf), newly hatched chicks were exposed to a small robot so that they could bond with it. The robot would then move randomly, as determined by a random number generator. However, when the chick was nearby, [*the robot moved non-randomly.*](https://imgur.com/a/WM2Rn7n) ***It was as if the chicks emotional desire for the robot to be nearby influenced the robot’s movement.*** It has also been shown that human consciousness and intention can affect the behavior of [random number generators](https://imgur.com/iSV0aJ0) and [water.](https://youtu.be/tAvzsjcBtx8)

* "The ways are but two: love and the want of love." - [Mencius, 300 B.C.](https://w.wiki/Cu6)

* “This becoming one instead of two, was the very expression of humanity’s ancient need. And the reason is that human nature was originally one and we were a whole, and the desire and pursuit of the whole is called love.” - [Plato, The Symposium, 385–370 BC.](https://w.wiki/CkG)

* “The love that you withhold is the pain that you carry.” - [Alex Collier](https://youtu.be/oQZgAEA95s8?t=2010)

### Unity

* *“There is only one truth, only men describe it in different ways.”* - [Rig-Veda](https://imgur.com/OED2lmd)

* "No one can study ancient philosophies seriously without perceiving the striking similitude of conception between all. The result of no mere coincidence, but of a *concurrent design:* and that there was, during the youth of mankind, ***one language, one knowledge, one universal religion, when there were no churches, no creeds or sects..."*** - [H. P. Blavatsky, The Secret Doctrine](https://www.theosociety.org/pasadena/sd/sd1-2-03.htm)

* "Every priest of an ancient creed was one of the Initiates, that is to say, ***he knew perfectly well that only one religion existed***, and that the cultus merely served to translate this religion to the different nations according to their particular temperaments. To anyone possessing the key, ***all these Bibles reveal the same doctrine***; but this key, which can open Esoterism, is lost by the sectarians of our Western creeds. Yet every cultus has its tradition, its book, its Bible, which teach those who know how to read them ***the unity of all creeds, in spite of the differences existing in the ritual of various countries."*** - [The Tarot of the Bohemians](http://www.sacred-texts.com/tarot/tob/index.htm)

* "The [Bahá'í Faith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD_Faith_and_the_unity_of_religion) states that there is a fundamental unity in many of the world's religions. It is one of the core teachings, alongside the unity of God, and the unity of humanity."

* "Behold, how good and pleasant it is when brothers ***dwell in unity***!" - [Psalm 133:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+133%3A1&version=KJV) 

* "Finally, all of you, ***have unity of mind***, sympathy, brotherly love, a tender heart, and a humble mind." - [1 Peter 3:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Peter+3%3A8&version=KJV)

* "The definition of Kabbalah is receptiveness. Having *seamless unity* from self to the whole. Like a hologram, everything is continuously interconnected as ***one integral unity."*** - [Rabbi Simon Jacobson.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-myHhrUTOIo) 

* “That Universal Being, that contains all, and which is all, put into motion the Soul and the World, all that nature comprises. In the manifold  ***unity of universal life,*** the innumerable individualities distinguished by their variations, are, nevertheless, united in such a manner that the whole is one, and that ***everything proceeds from Unity.”*** - [Hermes, Asclepios](https://www.sacred-texts.com/eso/vow/vow09.htm) 

* "The Soul contains all things but holds them all in an ***unextended unity.*** Differences unfold themselves, contraries are produced, but all is drawn into one organized system by the unity at the source. When you know that you have become this perfect work, when you are self-gathered in the purity of your being, ***nothing now remaining can shatter that inner unity...*** From unity they have arisen, and towards unity, they strive. ***Unity is thus identical with Goodness;*** for no being ever came into existence without possessing, from that very moment, an irresistible tendency towards unity. - [Plotinus, Enneads, 204-270 AD.](https://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/plotenn/index.htm) 

* "That which is infinite cannot be many, for many-ness is a finite concept. To have infinity you must identify or define the infinity as unity. ***This unity is all that there is."*** - [Ra](https://redd.it/6dbh63) / [Carla Rueckert, Law of One](https://www.llresearch.org/home.aspx) 

* “Above all other relationships he recognizes ***the universal brotherhood of every living thing.*** The symbol of the clasped hands, explained in the Lodge, reflects his attitude towards all the world, for he is the comrade of all created things. - [The Lost Keys of Freemasonry](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Lost_Keys_of_Freemasonry/Introduction)

* "The first peace, which is most important, is that which comes within the souls of men when they realize their relationship, ***their oneness, with the universe*** and all its Powers, and when they realize that at the center of the universe dwells Wakan-Tanka, and that this center is really everywhere, it is within each of us. This is the real Peace, and the others are but reflections of this. The second peace is that which is made between two individuals, and the third is that which is made between two nations. But above all you should understand that there can never be peace between nations until there is first known that true peace which, as I have often said, is within the souls of men." - [Hehaka Sapa, Wichasha Wakan](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Black_Elk)

* "Every separate existent is an adjusted part, ***holding its own characteristic and yet contributing by its own native tendency to the entire life-history of the Universe.*** All blending into a kosmos that must be alert throughout, every member living by its own life, nothing that can have existence failing to exist within it. The All could not have its huge life unless its every member had a life of its own. ***The secret lies in a variety within a unity. And on what has thus been compacted to unity, Beauty enthrones itself."*** - [Plotinus, Enneads, 204-270 AD.](https://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/plotenn/index.htm) 

* “And all the books you've read have been read by other people. And all the songs you've loved have been heard by other people. And that girl that's pretty to you is pretty to other people. And that if you looked at these facts when you were happy, ***you would feel great because you are describing 'unity***.” - [Stephen Chbosky](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/9625-and-all-the-books-you-ve-read-have-been-read-by)

### Coalescence

* *"Things of nature tend by their very nature to coalesce with each other...* - [Plotinus, Enneads, 204-270 AD.](https://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/plotenn/index.htm)

* [Huayan](https://w.wiki/DAj) is a tradition of Mahayana Buddhist philosophy that developed the doctrine of [*"coalescence."*](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/coalesce) Huayan holds that all phenomena are deeply interconnected.

* [Taoism](https://w.wiki/EPJ) is a Chinese tradition that emphasizes living in harmony with the Tao or 'the Way.' It refers to the principle that is the source, [pattern](https://imgur.com/bIOsFV5) and substance of everything that exists.

* [The All](https://w.wiki/DRw) is the Hermetic, pantheistic, pandeistic or panentheistic view of God, which is that everything that is, or at least that can be experienced, collectively makes up The All. 

* [Emanationism](https://w.wiki/Cx5) is an idea in the cosmology or cosmogony of certain religious or philosophical systems. Emanation meaning "to flow from" is the mode by which all things are derived from the [first reality,](https://imgur.com/VLj0OER) or [principle.](https://i.imgur.com/UUTZrPU.jpg)

* "All differences in this world are of degree, and not of kind, because oneness is the secret of everything." - [Swami Vivekananda](https://w.wiki/CwK)

* "Ultimately, the entire universe has to be understood as a single undivided whole, in which analysis into separately and independently existent parts has no fundamental status." - [David Bohm, Physicist](https://imgur.com/v97AaL2)

* "The whole of Gurmat wisdom has been summarized most beautifully into one single digit. Ik ***"Oneness"*** means everything in the whole entire creation is one thing that looks like many different things. - [Satpal Singh](https://youtu.be/pTRTtYUONgs)

* ***"All flows from one source englobing and safeguarding all qualities-*** sweetness with fragrance, wine- quality and the savours of everything that may be tasted, all colours seen, everything known to touch, all that ear may hear, all melodies, every rhythm. ***For all There is heaven;*** earth is heaven, and sea heaven; and animal and plant and man; all is the heavenly content of that heaven: and the Gods in it... ***The soul which has never strayed from this love waits for no reminding from the beauty of our world... for it sees that all is put together..."*** - [Plotinus, Enneads, 204-270 AD.](https://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/plotenn/index.htm) 

* "Here forms, here colors, here the character of every part of the universe are concentrated to a ***point***; and that point is *so marvelous a thing … Oh! marvelous, O stupendous Necessity* — by thy laws thou dost compel every effect to be the direct result of its cause, by the shortest path. *These are miracles..."* - [Leonardo da Vinci](https://w.wiki/CzH)

*  "God is a circle whose center is everywhere, and its circumference nowhere." - [Empedocles](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/109200)

* "Form is emptiness, emptiness is form / Emptiness is not separate from form, form is not separate from emptiness / Whatever is form is emptiness, whatever is emptiness is form." - [The Heart Sutra](https://w.wiki/Cpa)

* "Physical objects are not in space, but these objects are spatially extended. In this way, the concept of "empty space" loses its meaning." - [Albert Einstein](https://imgur.com/JrMMIj6) 

* "Emptiness is not nothing, it's everything, everything at once." - [The Womb of Buddhas](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1056304)

* "All nature, all formations, all creatures exist in and with one another, and they will be resolved again into their own roots." - [Gospel of Mary](http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/gospelmary.html)

* ***"A vast similitude interlocks all*** … All souls, all living bodies though they be ever so different … All identities that have existed or may exist on this globe, or any other globe, All lives, and deaths, all of the past, present, future, This vast similitude spans them, and always has spanned, And shall forever span them and compactly hold and enclose them." - [Walt Whitman](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/48856/on-the-beach-at-night-alone)

* “Basically, everything is one. There is no way in which you draw a line between things. What we do is make these subdivisions, but they’re *not real.* I think maybe poets … have some understanding of this.” - [Barbara McClintock, Nobel Prize-Winning physiologist](https://imgur.com/yZWAwKE)

* "Inconceivable as it seems to ordinary reason, you — and all other conscious beings as such — are all in all." - [Erwin Schrödinger, Nobel Prize-Winning physicist](https://w.wiki/CmV)

* And I think [the sages] point to the same depth in you, and in me, and in all of us. I think they are plugged into the All…. ***Your identity is indeed the All,*** and you are no longer part of that stream, you are that stream, with the All unfolding not around you but in you. - [Ken Wilber, A Brief History of Everything](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40363634)

* "If there is any such thing at all as intelligence, and love, and beauty, well, you’ve found it in other people. It exists in us as human beings. If it is there, in us, it is symptomatic of the scheme of things, as the apples are symptomatic of the apple tree or the rose of the rose bush. ***Our existence on the Earth is a symptom of the solar system,*** and its balances, as much as the solar system, in turn, is a symptom of our galaxy, and our galaxy in its turn is a symptom of the whole company of galaxies." - [Alan Watts](https://youtu.be/yYGHX8MgaX8)

* "God is one in Hasidic teachings means not God is one, but that ***everything is part of the divine.*** That means we're all connected. It means we're all children of God. It means we can all be here for each other. It means we're responsible for the world." - [Rabbi Yosef Yitzchak](https://youtu.be/iKd84AVZkIw?t=384)

* "Detachment is not the absence of emotion, it is the process of **becoming one with the Oneness that is the Universe.** To be detached, is to realize that the fullness of all there is, is too much to react to with just one emotion, one thought, or any bias. To be detached, is to acknowledge all, without owning any of it. To be detached, is to summon forth the whole entirety of understanding, to the fragment that is the void." - [Justin K. McFarlane Beau](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/1390332-detachment-is-not-the-absence-of-emotion-it-is-the)

* "Throw yourself flat on the ground, stretched out upon Mother Earth, with certain conviction that you are one with her and she with you..." - [Erwin Schrödinger, Nobel Prize-Winning physicist](https://w.wiki/CmV)

* "We often say that you can only think one thing at a time. The truth is that in looking at the world bit by bit we convince ourselves that it consists of separate things, and so give ourselves the problem of how these things are connected and how they cause and effect each other. The problem would never have arisen if we had been aware that it was ***just our way of looking at the world which had chopped it up into separate bits, things, events, causes, and effects.*** So-called opposites, such as light and darkness, are poles or aspects of the same thing. But we have no word for that thing, save such vague concepts as Existence, Being, God, or the Ultimate Ground of Being. We really feel that this world is indeed an assemblage of separate things that have somehow come together or, perhaps, fallen apart, and that we are each only one of them. In other words, we do not play the Game of Black-and-White. Instead, we play the game of Black-versus-White or, more usually, White-versus Black. Not realizing the inseparability of the positive and negative poles of the rhythm. Now you can begin to see the world as it is. ***And you don't see any past, and you don't see any future. You don't see a difference between yourself and the rest of it.*** - [Alan Watts, On the Taboo Against Knowing Who You Are](https://terebess.hu/english/AlanWatts-On%20The%20Taboo%20Against%20Knowing%20Who%20You%20Are.pdf)

* ​"The self is fundamentally an illusion arising as a reflection of the soul in matter, much as a clear lake at midnight reflects the moon." - [Fred Alan Wolf, theoretical physicist](https://imgur.com/OAbRtib)

* "***No such thing as selves exist in the world.*** At least for all conscious beings so far known to us it is true that they neither have nor are a self.

* "Just as one is free from the ideas of 'me' and 'mine' in respect of others' bodies, so, one becomes free from those ideas in respect of one's own body when one knows the Supreme Truth." - [Upadesa Sahasri](https://www.shastras.com/adi-sankara/upadesa-sahasri/)

* "If I am I because I am I, and you are you because you are you, then I am I and you are you. But if I am I because you are you and you are you because I am I, then I am not I and you are not you!" - [Menachem Mendel of Kotzk](https://w.wiki/F47)

* "What I’m doing at the moment is not completely described unless your being here is described also. In order to describe my behavior, I have to describe your behavior and the behavior of the environment... That what I am involves what you are. ***I don’t know who I am unless I know who you are. And you don’t know who you are unless you know who I am.*** We define each other; we’re all backs and fronts to each other. We know who we are in terms of other people; ***we all lock together."***  - [Alan Watts](https://youtu.be/yYGHX8MgaX8)

* "The wise man beholds all beings in the Self, and the Self in all beings; for that reason, he does not hate anyone." -  [Isa Upanishad](http://www.ishwar.com/hinduism/holy_upanishads/isa_upanishad/)

* "We do not need a new religion or a new bible. We need a new experience--a new feeling of what it to be "I." The lowdown (which is, of course, the secret and profound view) on life is that ***our normal sensation of self is a hoax*** or, at best, a temporary role that we are playing, or have been conned into playing. If you know that "I", in the sense of the person, the front, the ego, it really doesn't exist, then it won't go to your head too badly." - [Alan Watts](https://genius.com/Alan-watts-the-book-chapter-1-lyrics)

* "Establish yourself firmly in the awareness of 'I AM'. This is the beginning, and also the end of all endeavor. Give up all questions except one: ‘Who am I?’ After all, the only fact you are sure of is that you are. The ‘I am’ is certain. The ‘I am this’ is not. ***Nothing, concrete or abstract, which you perceive can be you.*** The very act of perceiving shows that you are not what you perceive. Once you are convinced that you cannot say truthfully about your self anything except ‘I am’, and ***that nothing that can be pointed at, can be your self***, the need for the ‘I am’ is over -- you are no longer intent on verbalizing what you are. All you need is to get rid of the tendency to define your self." - [Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj](https://www.nonduality.com/beyond.htm)

### Consciousness

* *"[Consciousness](https://imgur.com/JxX7RFX) is the ear of the ear, the thought of the thought, the speech of the speech, the breath of the breath and the eye of the eye…"* - [Upadesa Sahasri](https://www.shastras.com/adi-sankara/upadesa-sahasri/) 

* "Consciousness is not something that you have, it's something that you are." - [Eckhart Tolle](http://subtitlelist.com/en/Eckhart-Tolle--The-Never-Ending-Present-Moment-258)

* "I believe that consciousness is, essentially, the way information feels when being processed." – [Max Tegmark, physicist/cosmologist](https://www.edge.org/response-detail/10655)

* "The fact that the universe is comprehensible is a miracle. The eternal mystery of the world is its comprehensibility." - [Albert Einstein](https://w.wiki/Czr)

* [Indefinite Monism](https://w.wiki/DRp) is a philosophical conception of reality that asserts that only Awareness is real. Awareness in this system is not equivalent to consciousness. Rather, Awareness is the venue for consciousness.

* "The one prevailing idea found in all ancient teaching is that the whole Kosmos has sprung from the divine thought. Everything in the Universe is conscious. Consciousness contains the cognizer, the thing cognized and the cognition, ***all three in itself and all three one."*** - [H. P. Blavatsky, The Secret Doctrine](https://www.theosociety.org/pasadena/sd/sd1-1-03.htm)

* "[It from Bit](https://w.wiki/CwH) symbolizes the idea that every item of the physical world has at bottom — at a very deep bottom, in most instances — an immaterial source and explanation; that what we call reality arises in the last analysis from the posing of yes-no questions and the registering of equipment-evoked responses; in short, that all things physical are information-theoretic in origin and this is a ***participatory universe.***" - [John Archibald Wheeler, theoretical physicist](https://cqi.inf.usi.ch/qic/wheeler.pdf)

* "When you sense and perceive of yourself, where do those sensations and perceptions occur? They occur here in your field of consciousness. They are nothing but modulations of consciousness. They are made of consciousness. ***Your body is made of consciousness. Your body exists in your mind."*** - [Mark Gober, An End to Upside Down Thinking](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39022157)

* "What was it like to wake up after having never gone to sleep? That was when you were born. You didn't come into this world, you came out of it. You are something the whole universe is doing in the same way that a wave is something that the whole ocean is doing." - [Alan Watts](https://genius.com/Alan-watts-the-real-you-annotated)

* "Body consciousness and the world are not different; they are identical." - [Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj](http://realizedone.com/post/the-final-talks-of-sri-nisargadatta-maharaj-talk/) 

* "When you make the two one, and when you make the inner as the outer and the outer as the inner and the above as the below then shall you enter the Kingdom. If those who lead you say to you, 'See, the kingdom is in the sky,' then the birds of the sky will precede you. If they say to you, 'It is in the sea,' then the fish will precede you. Rather, the kingdom is inside of you, and it is outside of you." - [The Gospel of Thomas](http://www.gnosis.org/naghamm/gthlamb.html)

* "How does your mind look to your eyes? It looks like what you see out in front of you. Because all that you see out in front of you is how you feel inside your head." - [Alan Watts](https://youtu.be/B-_dtyHYwOU?t=61)

* "Let a man first purify himself and then observe: ***he will see all things in an Intellectual substance, himself having become an Intellectual Kosmos...*** No doubt since knower, knowing, and known, are identical, all merges into a unity... No longer is there a spectator outside gazing on an outside spectacle; ***the clear-eyed hold the vision within themselves...*** In that Intellectual Kosmos, where all is one total, every entity that can be singled out is an intellective essence and a participant in life... ***For every real being must be in actuality not merely in potentiality..."*** - [Plotinus, Enneads, 204-270 AD.](https://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/plotenn/index.htm) 

* "When the mind becomes very silent, you can clearly see that all that exists in the world are brief moments of consciousness arising together with the six sense objects. If you can make the mind very focused you see that the whole world breaks down into these small events of sight and the knowing, sound and the knowing, thought and the knowing. ***No longer are these houses, cars, bodies or even oneself. All you see are particles of consciousness as experience.*** You will see differently that consciousness is like waves, like a sea, an ocean. ***Now it is not particles but instead every sight and every sound is contained in this ocean of consciousness.*** From this perspective, there is no sense of particles at all." - [Jack Kornfield](https://imgur.com/sYAw0zf)

* *"My world is myself. I am at home.* ***You are the pure awareness that illuminates consciousness and its infinite content. Awareness is primordial;*** it is the original state, beginningless, endless, uncaused, unsupported, without parts, without change. There can be no consciousness without awareness, but there can be awareness without consciousness... ***Awareness is the common matrix of every experience."*** - [Sri Nisargadatta Mahara, I Am That](https://holybooks-lichtenbergpress.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/I-Am-That-by-Sri-Nisargadatta-Maharaj.pdf) 

* ***"There are no distinctions such as the knower, the knowledge and the known.*** In the dream state, even though there is no contact with the external world, the mind alone projects the entire dream-universe of the enjoyer, etc. Similarly, the waking-state is [no different.](https://youtu.be/UfV89yz7bug) ***All this world of myriad phenomena is but a projection of the mind.*** Just as the wave, the surf, the whirlpool, the bubbles, etc. are all, in essence, nothing but water, so too, ***Consciousness alone is everything from the body, to the ego.*** - [Vivekachudamani](https://www.arshabodha.org/adiShankara/Vivekachudamani_eBook.pdf) 

* "The Universe is Mental--held in the Mind of THE ALL." - [The Kybalion](https://www.sacred-texts.com/eso/kyb/kyb07.htm)

* "According to my view of quantum theory, matter does not produce consciousness. It is the other way around. Consciousness produces material events." - [Norman Friedman, physicist](https://imgur.com/jhJH3I6)

* “I regard consciousness as fundamental. I regard matter as derivative from consciousness.” - [Max Planck, Nobel Prize-winning physicist](https://w.wiki/DEz)

* “Consciousness does not exist because the physical world does; the physical world exists because consciousness does." - [Jim Tucker, Ph.D.](https://imgur.com/yE84GmL)

* "The universe is of the nature of a thought or sensation in a universal Mind... To put the conclusion crudely — the stuff of the world is mind-stuff." - [Arthur Eddington, astrophysicist](https://w.wiki/CwG)

* "Consciousness is the source of all reality. The entire human being, brain, consciousness and all, is like the universe which surrounds him, nothing more or less than an extraordinarily complex system of energy fields." - [De-classified CIA document](https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00788R001700210016-5.pdf)

* "Our individual mind is seen as a part of a larger universal consciousness, being instrumental in the entire fabric of reality. This is so, since the conscious activity of an observer observing the change of an observable is, per definition mathematically not computable." - [Dirk K.F. Meijer, pharmacologist, Conscious Universe](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320267484)

* "Consciousness is much more of the implicate order than is matter . . . Yet at a deeper level [matter and consciousness] are actually inseparable and interwoven, just as in the computer game the player and the screen are united by participation." - [David Bohm, theoretical physicist](https://w.wiki/Cwg)

* "The universe begins to look more like a great thought than like a great machine. Mind no longer appears as an accidental intruder into the realm of matter; we are beginning to suspect that we ought rather to hail it as a creator and governor of the realm of matter..." - [James Jeans, physicist/astronomer](https://w.wiki/Cx9)

* "God is cause of Himself; for Himself and of Himself He is what He is, the first self, transcendently The Self. Since no other has generated Him, He is what He made Himself: He is not, therefore, as He happened to be but as He acted Himself into being. He had no need of being who brought it to be. All is always so and all is always so reproduced: therefore the reason-principles of things must lie always within the producing powers in a still more perfect form... The act of the will must be self-determined and the being self-caused; ***thus reason shows the Supreme to be its own Author..."*** - [Plotinus, Enneads, 204-270 AD.](https://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/plotenn/index.htm) 

* “We are a way for the cosmos to know itself.” ― [Carl Sagan, Cosmos](https://w.wiki/Ckm)

* "Man is the most insane species. He worships an invisible God and destroys a visible Nature. Unaware that the Nature he is destroying is this God he is worshipping." - [Hubert Reet](https://imgur.com/R676L9R) 

* "The external world is as much you as your own body. Your skin doesn’t separate you from the world. It’s a bridge through which the external world flows into you, and you flow into it. - [Alan Watts](https://youtu.be/yYGHX8MgaX8)

* "Salt is a simple here, and yet a manifold. This thing is therefore white only in so far as it is brought in contact with our eye, also sharp to our tongue, also cubic to our touch, etc. The entire diversity of these sides we do not receive from the thing, but from ourselves. Thus they (the sides) fall asunder on our senses which are separate from each other. ***We are therefore the universal medium in which such moments isolate themselves***, and are for and by themselves. But these different sides which consciousness takes upon itself are determined each for itself, as it is found in the universal medium; the White is merely in opposition to the Black, etc., and the thing is One precisely through the fact that it opposes itself to others. But it does not exclude others from itself through being One, ***for to be One is the universal relation to itself, and from the fact that it is One it is rather like to all."*** - [Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, The Phenomenology of Spirit](https://archive.org/stream/jstor-25665651/25665651_djvu.txt)

* "Imagine that all of reality is a stream of water, where water represents consciousness. Now imagine that within the stream, whirlpools form. While they may *look different* from other parts of the stream, the whirlpools are made of nothing more than water. ***To say that the brain generates mind is as absurd as to say that a whirlpool generates water.*** - [Bernardo Kastrup, Ph.D.](https://imgur.com/jca3hDu)

* "There is nothing about a brain, studied at any scale, that even suggests that it might harbor consciousness." - [Sam Harris, neuroscientist](https://samharris.org/the-mystery-of-consciousness-ii/)

* “It is very difficult for us to take stock of the fact that the localization of the personality, of the conscious mind, inside the body is only symbolic, just an aid for practical use.” - [Erwin Schrödinger, Nobel Prize-Winning physicist](https://www.organism.earth/library/document/mind-and-matter)

* “Mind is first. Consciousness exists independently of brain activity. It does not depend upon the brain for its survival. The brain is not the creator of the mind, it is an antenna/receiver for the mind." - [Gary Schwartz, psychologist](https://imgur.com/5yj3uUL)

* "Matter is not that which produces consciousness, but that which limits it and confines its intensity within certain limits.” - [F. C. S. Schiller, philosopher](https://archive.org/details/riddlesofsphinx00schiuoft/page/n6)

* “As a neurosurgeon, I was taught that the brain creates consciousness…The truth is that the more we come to understand the physical brain, the more we realize it does not create consciousness at all. ***We are conscious in spite of our brain.*** The brain serves more as a reducing valve or filter, limiting pre-existing consciousness..." - [Eben Alexander, neurosurgeon](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6170087/)

* "The idea that a consciousness can exist and make memories independent of the brain … is a startling finding." - Dr. Allan Hamilton, Harvard Ph.D. (Commenting on a patient’s detailed memories that occurred when they had *[no brain activity.](https://youtu.be/rlfYnuNR3lI?t=111)*)

* Neuropsychologist Karl Lashley wanted to understand where memories are stored in the brain. To do this, he trained rats to do tasks for food. Once they learned the task, he systematically destroyed one part of their brain at a time. Miraculously, ***[the rats could still perform the tasks](https://i.imgur.com/U5Ophyh.png)*** regardless of which part of the brain was destroyed. This test was also successful with both [*monkeys*](https://i.imgur.com/KS61wjr.png), [*salamanders*](http://www.instinct.org/texts/shufflebrain/shufflebrain-book05.html) and has been naturally [*observed in humans.*](https://imgur.com/MRLQFEL)

* “I have been and still am a seeker, but I no longer seek in stars and books; I have begun to listen to the teachings my blood whispers to me." - [Hermann Hesse](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/28811)

* [Collective Unconscious](https://w.wiki/Doc) is a term that refers to structures of the unconscious mind which are shared among beings of the same species. Coined by Carl Jung who stated - *"In addition to our immediate consciousness there exists a second psychic system of a collective, universal, and impersonal nature which is identical in all individuals. This collective unconscious does not develop individually but is inherited."*

* "No self is of itself alone. It has a long chain of intellectual ancestors. The "I" is chained to ancestry by many factors … This is not mere allegory, but an eternal memory." - [Erwin Schrödinger, Nobel Prize-Winning physicist](https://w.wiki/CmV)

* “People say I have created things. I have never created anything. I get impressions from the Universe at large and work them out, but I am only a plate on a record or a receiving apparatus—what you will. Thoughts are really impressions that we get from outside.” - [Thomas Edison](https://imgur.com/C9YzCiK)

* "All knowledge that the world has ever received comes from the mind; the infinite library of the universe is in our own mind." - [Swami Vivekananda](https://w.wiki/CwK)

* "In every entity the essential nature is the governing principle... This Soul, imparts the pattern of the Kosmos, the Ideas for which it has itself received from the Intellectual-Principle as the soul or mind of the craftsman draws upon his craft for the plan of his work." - [Plotinus, Enneads, 204-270 AD.](https://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/plotenn/index.htm) 

* “There is one mind common to all individual men. What Plato has thought, he may think; what a saint has felt, he may feel; what at any time has befallen any man, he can understand. Who hath access to this universal mind is a party to all that is or can be done.” - [Ralph Waldo Emerson](https://imgur.com/0LmC7Zw)

* “Like a hologram, each region of space-time contains information about every other point in space-time. This information is readily available to our awareness. In the holographic universe … there is a unity of consciousness—***a ‘greater collective mind’***—with no boundaries of space or time.” - [Russell Targ, physicist](https://imgur.com/TqE2Z5r)

* “In any great discovery we find the often disturbing and happy experience: ‘It is not I; I have not done this.’ Still, in a certain way it is I—yet not the ego … but … a more comprehensive self." - [Baron Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker, physicist/philosopher](https://imgur.com/VeXdOXN)

* ***"I think that there may well be a flow of pattern which crosses species lines and allows organisms to borrow each other’s ideas…*** As a biologist, I am aware at times—especially when steeped in some natural cycle—of a kind of consciousness that is timeless, unlimited by space or by the confines of my own identity. I find myself, at these times, ***with knowledge that comes directly from being part of something very much larger, a sort of global ecology of mind.*** *And the experience of it is literally wonderful."* - [Lyall Watson, biologist](https://imgur.com/FtGIS3f)

* “I'm not entirely closed to the possibility that there is some link to a universal knowledge.…It seems like savants, especially autistic savants, know so many things they haven’t learned, and it’s almost as if they tapped into a ***universal knowledge.”*** - [Dr. Darold Treffert, psychiatry professor](https://www.eldontaylor.com/provocativeenlightenment/2017-0810-islands-of-genius-with-darold-a-treffert-m-d/)

* In 2016 the CIA [released results](https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP79-00999A000300030027-0.pdf) of studies conducted on Israeli psychic Uri Geller. ***Geller successfully described and [drew pictures](https://imgur.com/kXcSWAC) that were outside of a shielded room.*** It's stated - *"As a result of Geller's success in this experimental period, we consider that he has demonstrated his perceptual ability in a convincing and unambiguous manner."*

* "The particular holographic type of consciousness, situated in the particular event horizons as a sort of bordering memory domains, can effectively function as a nested information workspace, that in humans is instrumental in constructing a mental model of reality for internal use in each individual, ***thus functioning as a global reference system. We propose this can be readily explained by a holographic memory space that contains the total history and future probability states of the particular cell..."*** - [Dirk K.F. Meijer, Conscious Universe](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320267484)

### Oneness

* "*This is It / and I am It / and You are It / and so is That / and He is It / and She is It / and It is It / and That is That.*" - [James Broughton](https://imgur.com/heIkNkk)

* "Nature by its very definition is a singulare tantum. I should say: the overall number of minds is just one." - [Erwin Schrödinger, Nobel Prize-winning physicist](https://i.imgur.com/ChHEYce.png)

* [Monism](https://w.wiki/Cwm) attributes oneness or singleness to existence. Priority monism states that all existing things go back to a source that is distinct from them; e.g., in Neoplatonism, everything is derived from ***[The One.](https://w.wiki/Cwn)***

* [Open individualism](https://w.wiki/DRt) is the view in the philosophy of personal identity, according to which there exists only ***one*** numerically identical subject, who is everyone at all times. 

* [Monopsychism](https://w.wiki/DRu) is the belief that all humans share the same eternal consciousness, soul, mind, and intellect.

* [Kashmir Shaivism](https://w.wiki/Cwz) refers to a nondualist tradition of Śaiva-Śakta Tantra which originated sometime after 850 CE. The goal is to recognize oneself as Shiva who is the entirety of the universe.

* "We may think of the One as a light before the light, an eternal irradiation resting upon the Intellectual Realm; this, not identical with its source, is yet not severed from it nor of so remote a nature as to be less than Real-Being; it is no blind thing, but is seeing and knowing, ***the primal knower."*** - [Plotinus, Enneads, 204-270 AD.](https://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/plotenn/index.htm) 

* “Consciousness is a singular of which the plural is unknown; … there is only one thing and that, what seems to be a plurality, is merely a series of different aspects of this one thing...” - [Erwin Schrödinger, Nobel Prize-Winning physicist](https://w.wiki/Czt)

* “Deep down the consciousness of mankind is ***one.*** This is a virtual certainty because even in the vacuum matter is one; and if we don't see this, it's because we are blinding ourselves to it. ” - [David Bohm, theoretical physicist](https://w.wiki/CmH)

* "This Absolute Oneness alone is Real since there is nothing other than the Self. Truly, there is no other independent entity in the state of full realization of the supreme Truth." - [Vivekachudamani](https://www.arshabodha.org/adiShankara/Vivekachudamani_eBook.pdf)  

* "There is only One, the Self, who appears to be many to deluded vision, like the moon appearing more than one to eyes affected by amaurosis." - [Upadesa Sahasri](https://www.shastras.com/adi-sankara/upadesa-sahasri/)

* “Each of us is, as such, the same person, apparently diversified and separated through the kaleidoscope of thought and perception.…***We are literally each other.*** Each of us is the outer face, or the objectification, of the only mind there is, eternal, infinite consciousness. We are all mirrors of the same consciousness.” - [Rupert Spira, The Nature of Consciousness](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31142905)

* "He who sees Me in everything and everything in Me, him shall I never forsake, nor shall he lose Me." - [The Bhagavad Gita](https://www.holybooks.com/wp-content/uploads/The-Bhagavad-Gita-Translation-by-Shri-Purohit-Swami.pdf)

* “I honor the place in you that is the same in me. I honor in you where the entire Universe resides. I honor the place in you of love, of light, of peace and of truth. I honor the place in you, that is the same in me. ***There is but one."*** - [Namaste, ​Ancient Sanskrit](https://imgur.com/iKmsG9Y)

* ***"Present entire at every point of the body and the universe, an identity numerically one, undivided entire, omnipresent.*** Seeking nothing, possessing nothing, lacking nothing, the One is perfect and has overflowed, and its exuberance has produced the new: this product has turned again to its begetter and been filled and has become its contemplator and so an *Intellectual-Principle."* - [Plotinus, Enneads, 204-270 AD.](https://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/plotenn/index.htm) 

* "Today a young man on acid realised we are all just energy condensed to a *slooooow* vibration. We are all one consciousness, experiencing itself subjectively. There is no such thing as death, life is only a dream and we're the imagination of ourselves.

###Timelessness

* *"If time is, admittedly, endless, how can number apply to it?"* - [Plotinus, Enneads, 204-270 AD.](https://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/plotenn/index.htm) 

* [Philosophical presentism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_presentism) is the view that neither the future nor the past exists.

* According to Einstein's [Relativity of simultaneity,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_of_simultaneity) simultaneity is not an absolute relation between events; what is simultaneous in one frame of reference will not necessarily be simultaneous in another. As Einstein's theory of relativity explains, if you were to travel at the speed of light then strange things would happen to space and time, and you would experience yourself to be in all places and times at once. - [Example 1,](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/78/Relativity_of_Simultaneity_Animation.gif) [Example 2.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/72/Traincar_Relativity2.svg) 

* “The distinction between past and present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion.” - [Albert Einstein](https://imgur.com/F8pPVvb)

* "[The specious present](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specious_present) consists of three nonentities—the past, which does not exist, the future, which does not exist, and their conterminous, the present; the faculty from which it proceeds lies to us in the fiction of the specious present." - E. Robert Kelly

* “Past and future are myths: stories of the mind. You cannot escape the present; ever; not even theoretically." - [Bernardo Kastrup, Ph.D., philosopher](https://imgur.com/4L4nv51)

* "Only the present day and present moment are real." - [Hasidic master Rabbi Nachman](https://w.wiki/CwJ)

* "The present is the future’s past, and is therefore what has already occurred on the way to a (now) pre-existing future fulfillment. . . . It is the future that is doing the creating of a past congruent with itself and it is the present that chooses itself to be congruently the past of a particular future.” - [Carl Buchheit, Ph.D.](https://imgur.com/vRy7hmo)

* "Imagine the Earth devoid of human life. Would it still have a past and a future? Could we still speak of time in any meaningful way? The question "What time is it?" or "What's the date today?" The oak tree or the eagle would be bemused by such a question. "What time?" they would ask. ***"Well, of course, it's now. The time is now. What else is there?"*** - [Eckhart Tolle, Power of the Now](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6708.The_Power_of_Now)

* ***"There is nothing peculiar in the present event to make it different from the past and future.*** For a moment the past was actual and the future will become so. What makes the present so different? A thing focused in the now is with me, for I am ever-present; it is my own reality that I impart to the present event. We consider memories, only when they come into the present. The forgotten is not counted until one is reminded -- which implies, ***bringing into the now."*** - [Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj, I Am That](http://www.prahlad.org/gallery/nisargadatta/I_Am_That.pdf)

* “The experience of ‘there’ takes place here, just as the experience of the past or future takes place now. It is not possible to leave ‘here’ and visit ‘there.’ ‘There’ is always a concept, never an experience. Space is the distance between the point ‘here’ and the point ‘there,’ or between two points ‘there.’ However, only here is experienced. We are not moving through time and space. Time and space are, as it were, moving through us. I never go anywhere. ***I am always in the same place of ‘I am,’ the placeless place called here, the timeless time called now.”*** - [Rupert Spira, The Nature of Consciousness](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31142905-the-nature-of-consciousness)

* “Ultimately all the moments are really one, … therefore now is eternity…. Everything, including me, is dying every moment into eternity and being born again.” - [David Bohm, physicist](http://www.fdavidpeat.com/interviews/bohm.htm) 

* "So far as we know, animals do not live in constant anxiety about sickness and death, as we do, ***because they live in [the present.](https://www.quora.com/How-do-insects-experience-time)*** There was never a time when the world began, because it goes round and round like a circle, and there is no place on a circle where it begins. There was no past. ***If the universe began in the past, when that happened it was now.*** But it is still now and the universe is still beginning now and it’s trailing off like the wake of a ship from now and as the wake of the ship fades out, so does the past. You can look back there to explain things but the explanation disappears. You will never find it there. Things are not explained by the past. They’re explained by what happens now." - [Alan Watts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVVk67UZMJ0)

### Changelessness 

* *"The only secret people keep is immortality."* - [Emily Dickinson](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/204466)

* "All truth is *eternal.* Truth is nobody’s property; no race, no individual can lay any exclusive claim to it. Truth is the nature of all souls. - [Swami Vivekananda](https://w.wiki/CwK) 

* ***"Eternity means Ever-Being. Eternity is an unchanging unity.*** Neither coming to be nor passing away. Absolutely One, it has never known measure and stands outside of number... And having no constituent parts it accepts no pattern, forms no shape. Changelessly motionless and ever holding the Universal content in actual presence. All its content is in immediate concentration as at one point; nothing in it ever knows development: all remains identical within itself, ***knowing nothing of change.*** That which neither has been nor will be, but simply possesses being; that which enjoys stable existence as neither in process of change nor having ever changed- that is Eternity. ***Being itself could not make such an opposite into Being..."*** - [Plotinus, Enneads, 204-270 AD.](https://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/plotenn/index.htm) 

* The philosophy of [Sankara](https://w.wiki/CmD) states [Brahman](https://w.wiki/CmE) (Ultimate Reality) alone is real; the world is non-real, and the [The Ātman](https://w.wiki/CmF) (Self) is essentially not-different from Brahman. 

* "That which is ***changeless*** and so free from birth, growth, development, decay, disease, and death; which is indestructible and is the cause of creation, maintenance, and dissolution of the universe ― ***That Brahman Thou Art.*** - [Vivekachudamani](https://www.arshabodha.org/adiShankara/Vivekachudamani_eBook.pdf) 

* "The Atman alone warms the inner man; i.e., it enlightens it with the ray of divine life and alone is able to impart to the inner man, or the reincarnating Ego, its immortality." - [H. P. Blavatsky, The Secret Doctrine](https://www.theosociety.org/pasadena/sd/sd2-1-06.htm) *Fun fact* - Nobel Prize-winning physicist Erwin Schrödinger named his dog [Atman.](https://imgur.com/QHagizq)

* "One should know oneself to be the ***Supreme Brahman*** free from all bondage, merit and demerit, past and future, and also from cause and effect. Unlike the knowledge gained through the eyes etc. ***The knowledge of the Knower does not cease to exist.*** Like the heat and light of the sun, the Knowledge which is changeless, eternal and self-effulgent has an existence in the Self entirely independent of everything else. ***The Self is always the same in all beings and free from old age, death, and fear."*** - [Upadesa Sahasri](https://www.shastras.com/adi-sankara/upadesa-sahasri/)

* "The One is without boundaries. Nothing exists outside of it to border it. The One cannot be investigated. Nothing exists apart from it to investigate it. The One cannot be measured. Nothing exists external to it to measure it. It is not right to think of it as a God or as like God. It is more than just God. Nothing is above it. Nothing rules it. Since everything exists within it, it does not exist within anything. ***Since it is not dependent on anything it is eternal.*** It is absolutely complete and so needs nothing. It is utterly perfect. Light." - [The Secret Book of John](http://www.gnosis.org/naghamm/apocjn-davies.html)

* *"Close your eyes and think about it.* Can you pin down the “I” that is having experiences? Can you put a boundary or border on it? Can you confine it to a definitive space? The answer you will come to is that you can’t put anything finite around “I.” It’s not a finite thing, whatever it is. ***“I” is therefore infinite."*** - [Mark Gober, An End to Upside Down Thinking](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39022157)

* "There is really no before and after for the mind. There is only now that includes memories and expectations. I believe this strongly suggests the indestructibility of Mind...” - [Erwin Schrödinger, Nobel Prize-Winning physicist](https://imgur.com/vUiBH05)

* "Either life is Essential Reality, and therefore self-living- the very thing we have been seeking- ***and undeniably immortal:*** or it, too, is a compound and must be traced back through all the constituents until an immortal substance is reached, something deriving movement from itself, ***and therefore debarred from accepting death."*** - [Plotinus, Enneads, 204-270 AD.](https://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/plotenn/index.htm) 

* "Physical death does not entail the end of consciousness, for consciousness is the fabric of all existence." - [Bernardo Kastrup, Ph.D., philosopher](https://imgur.com/oRmzURk)

* "The only things born or destroyed are the illusions conjured by our misunderstanding. Permanence, pleasure, self-existence, and purity are used by people to establish the reality of the mundane world, the world of birth and death. Such views were considered to be mistaken by all early sects of Buddhism." - [The Womb of Buddhas](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1056304)

* "I can assure you that death is another beginning. In the dawn of physical existence, men knew that death was merely a change of form." - [Jane Roberts, The Seth Material](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/324424)

* ***“Self is only an idea, a mortal idea.*** That which passes into everything is one thing. It's a dream already ended. There's nothing to be afraid of and nothing to be glad about. Mountains will crumble, but the emptiness of space, which is the one universal essence of mind, the vast awakenerhood, empty and awake, will never crumble away because ***it was never born.”*** - [Jack Kerouac](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/7492) 

* There once was a tiny drop of rainwater that fell from the great, rolling skies far above and into a vast run river down below. ..and became it. And yet did the raindrop retain its very identity. Yet how could this be? For it was, after all, no longer a raindrop. It was now the river. It became the awareness of the river by realizing upon entering that it and the river ***had never been apart to begin with.*** As a raindrop, however, it had lost sight of this truth and felt itself small and separated. Upon entry into the river, its identity did not become replaced by the river's - the river's identity did not obliterate the raindrops. Rather, the raindrop came to ultimately realize that its true identity had all along been much more grand, much more vast than it had ever prior given itself credit for. The raindrop is the river. The atom is the universe. - [Freeman Broiler](http://i.imgur.com/ETTzpzU.png)

* "Of what arises from causes, the Buddha shows how it begins, and also how it ceases; thus does the Great Recluse instruct." - [Ashvajit](https://imgur.com/2xIWxAi)

* "When life and death are seen as essential to each other, as two aspects of one being, that is immortality. To see the end in the beginning and beginning in the end, is the intimation of eternity."- [Sri Nisargadatta Mahara, I Am That](https://holybooks-lichtenbergpress.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/I-Am-That-by-Sri-Nisargadatta-Maharaj.pdf)

* "We may be about to rediscover that dying is not such a bad thing to do after all." - [Sir William Osler, physician](https://imgur.com/8dB7GnP)

* "Men directing their weapons against each other- under doom of death yet neatly lined up to fight as in the pyrrhic sword-dances of their sport- this is enough to tell us that all human intentions are but play, ***that death is nothing terrible,*** that to die in a war or in a fight is but to taste a little beforehand what old age has in store, ***to go away earlier and come back the sooner."*** - [Plotinus, Enneads, 204-270 AD.](https://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/plotenn/index.htm) 

* *"Life is a beautiful, magnificent thing, even to a jellyfish...* The trouble is you won't fight. You've given in, continually dwelling on sickness and death. But there's something just as inevitable as death, and that's life. ***Life, life, life.*** Think of all the power that's in the universe, moving the earth, growing the trees. That's the same power within you if you only have the courage and the will to use it." - [Charlie Chaplin](https://youtu.be/LEX0v-jOLHA)

* *"And now, I endeavor that my divine part may return to that divine nature which flourishes throughout the universe."* - [Plotinus' final words, 270 AD.](https://imgur.com/2W225ao)
